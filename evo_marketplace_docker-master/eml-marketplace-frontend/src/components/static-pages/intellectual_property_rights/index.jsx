							<h2>Intellectual Property or Proprietary Rights</h2>
							<p>Intellectual Property/Proprietary Rights (IPR) means, but not limited to; all trade and business names, rights of attribution, trade marks, patents, design rights, copyright (including copyright in a computer program), registered designs, database rights,utility models, semi-conductor topography rights, inventions (whether or not patentable), know-how, confidential information and all other intellectual property and rights of a similar or corresponding nature in any part of the world, whether or not registered or capable of registration, in respect of such rights which are registrable and all applications for registration of any of the foregoing rights.</p>
							<h2>The Rights Ownership</h2>
							<p className="no-margin">A client might think that IPR automatically belong to them, since the freelancer was working on their project or idea; but this is not the case. All work done on client’s project automatically belongs to the freelancer. The IPR belongs to freelancer in the stated below scenarios:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Unless Stated Otherwise.</li>
								<li>Even If The Freelancer Is Fully Paid By The Client.</li>
								<li>Contract Time Period Expires, If any.</li>								
							</ol>
							<h2>Why IPR Is Important</h2>
							<p>Your Intellectual Property is your livelihood. As a freelancer, different than an employee, your unique, self (not group) - created products belongs to you.</p>
							<h2>The Client Want</h2>
							<p>Most clients want exclusive and indefinite use of the Intellectual Property that you create for the project. Some even grab “future” rights not yet invented, but related to the project.</p>
							<h2>The Freelancer Options</h2>
							<p>Freelancers always should try to grant the minimum IPR possible to the client.</p>
							<h2>Proprietary Rights Infringement Reporting Procedures</h2>
							<p>Limited Liability Company (“Wurker.ai”, “our”, “us” or “we”) provides these Proprietary Rights Infringement Reporting Procedures (these “Procedures”) to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding claims of infringement of proprietary rights by third parties on our website located at www.wurker.ai. These Procedures may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Procedures on the Site. You are advised to consult these Procedures regularly for any changes.</p>
							<p>If you are a proprietary rights owner and you believe someone is using Wurker.ai to infringe your proprietary rights, you may provide Wurker.ai with the notice described below (the “Notice”) to Wurker.ai's Legal Department by email to legalnotices@wurker.ai or by mail to Attn: Wurker.ai Legal, 1107 S.
