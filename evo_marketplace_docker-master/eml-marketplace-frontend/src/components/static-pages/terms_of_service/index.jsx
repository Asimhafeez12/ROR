									<h3>Service Contracts Direction for Freelancers</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Wurker.ai likely became aware of a potential issue due to your low level of client satisfaction. Low client satisfaction indicates a violation of Wurker.ai’s terms of Service for a number of reasons. The terms of Service requires freelancers to fulfill their contractual obligations to their clients by delivering high-quality work. In addition, the terms of Service requires you to accurately describe your business, your skills and qualifications, and the services you offer. If your client satisfaction score increases, Wurker.ai, in most cases, will understand that you have corrected the issues.</li>
										<li>You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Freelancers only take projects you (‘Freelancers’) are qualified for and can deliver on budget and on time: When you accept a contract with your client, you are promising to deliver certain work at a certain cost and by a certain time. If the scope of the work changes at any time, make sure to update the deadlines in your agreement with the client to consistently remain on time and budget.</li>
										<li>An agency must fulfill their contractual obligations to clients by delivering high-quality work. They also must accurately describe their business, skills, qualifications, and service offerings. As the owner of an agency account, you’re ultimately responsible for all contracts your agency and its freelancers enter into with your clients.</li>
